Build and Usage Instructions
============================

The easiest way to build and use Maxine is through the ``beehivelab/maxine-dev`` `docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/beehivelab/maxine-dev>`__.
This image comes with all dependencies installed and configured.
You only need to get the latest maxine sources and build them through the container.

Creating the docker container
-----------------------------

To create a docker container from the ``beehivelab/maxine-dev`` docker image run::

    docker create \
        -p 9873:873 \
        --mount src="/tmp/.X11-unix",target="/tmp/.X11-unix",type=bind \
        -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
        --name maxine-dev -ti beehivelab/maxine-dev

This will create a container named ``maxine-dev``.

- ``-p 9873:873`` maps port 9873 of the host to port 873 of the docker container.
- ``--mount src="/tmp/.X11-unix",target="/tmp/.X11-unix",type=bind`` mounts the host X11 socket to the container socket.
- ``-e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY`` passes in the ``DISPLAY`` environment variable.
- ``--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE`` enables ``ptrace`` capability for the container.
- ``--name maxine-dev`` names the new image so that it can later be referenced (to start it, stop it, attach to it etc.).
- ``-ti`` instructs docker to create an interactive session with a pseudo-tty, to allow us to interact with the container.

Initializing the container
--------------------------

The docker image expects the source code to be in the layout shown below::

    $ tree -L 1 maxine-src
    maxine-src
    ├── maxine
    └── mx

To get the source code in this layout execute::

    $ mkdir maxine-src
    $ git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git maxine-src/mx
    $ git clone https://github.com/beehive-lab/Maxine-VM.git maxine-src/maxine

Then start the container (on a different terminal) with::

    docker start -i maxine-dev

Return back to the main terminal and copy the ``maxine-src`` directory to the container using::

    rsync -avP maxine-src --delete rsync://localhost:9873/root/

Optionally copy over your ``~/.mx`` directory as well
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use ``mx`` locally as well you can use the same cache to avoid fetching again large files::

    rsync -avP ~/.mx --delete rsync://localhost:9873/root/

Using the ``maxine-dev`` container
----------------------------------

To use the container issue ``docker start -i maxine-dev``.
This will start the container and open a ``bash`` shell in it.
From this shell you can build and run maxine.

To exit the shell and stop the container type ``Ctrl-D``.

Keeping your data on the host in sync with your data on the docker container
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the container for development purposes you most probably will be interested in editing the source code on the host while building and running on the docker container.
To automatically synchronize your files from the host to the container use::

    fswatch -0 maxine-src | xargs -0 -n 1 -I {} rsync -avP maxine-src --delete rsync://localhost:9873/root/

Build
-----

- Enter the maxine source directory::

    cd $MAXINE_HOME

- Compile the source code::

    mx build

Executing ``mx build`` in the ``$MAXINE_HOME`` directory compiles the Java source code of Maxine to class files using ``javac`` (or the Eclipse batch compiler if you use the ``-jdt`` option) and compiles the native code of Maxine to executable code using your platform's C compiler.

The build process attempts to download some necessary files from the internet.
If you are behind a firewall set the ``HTTP_PROXY`` environment variable appropriately before starting the build.

- Generate the boot image::

    mx image

The ``mx image`` command is used to generate a boot image.
This command runs Maxine on a host JVM to configure a prototype, then compiles its own code and data to create an executable program for the target platform.

Running
-------

With the native substrate and a boot image built, the Maxine VM can now be executed.

The ``mx vm`` command handles the details of class and library paths and provides an interface similar to the standard java launcher command.

The ``mx`` script includes a command to run a simple HelloWorld program to verify that the VM is working::

    mx helloworld

Now let's use Maxine to run a more substantial program::

    mx vm -cp test/bin test.output.GCTest2

To launch the VM (or any other command for that matter) without using ``mx``, the ``-v`` option echoes the commands issued by the mx script::

    mx -v helloworld

Profiling
---------

Various profiling tools are available for the Java platform, with varying degrees of overhead.
Some tools require VM support and the Maxine VM includes two such tools.
The first is a simple sampling based profiler with minimal overhead that is provided in the standard VM image and enabled by the ``-Xprof`` command line option.
The second tool is the :doc:`Virtual Machine Level Analysis <./Virtual-Machine-Level-Analysis>` (VMA) system that works by instrumenting compiled code.
Using VMA requires a custom VM image to be built.

Sampling Profiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maxine includes a simple sampling-based profiler.
It is enabled with the ``-Xprof`` command line option.
The full syntax for the option is ``-Xprof:frequency=f,depth=d,dump=s,flat=t,sort=t,systhreads=t``, where everything after the ``-Xprof`` is optional.
The control arguments have the following interpretation:

-  **frequency=f**: Sets the frequency of the samples to ``f``
   milliseconds.
   The default is 10.
-  **depth=d**: Records the stacks of threads at sample points to a
   depth of ``d``.
   The default is 16.
-  **dump=s**: Dumps the accumulated stack traces every s seconds.
   The default is zero which results in the traces being output only at
   VM termination.
-  **sort=t**: Sorts the stack traces by thread and sample counts if t
   is true.
   The default value is true unless dump is non-zero, as the sorting
   incurs both CPU and allocation overhead.
   In unsorted mode the stack traces are output in an arbitrary order,
   each followed by the list of threads and sample counts for that
   trace.
   In sorted mode, the traces for each thread are output separately,
   with the traces ordered from highest to lowest sample count.
-  **flat=t**: If t is true, the output is sorted and, for each sample,
   only the method at the top of the stack is listed.
   Therefore, this option also implies ``depth=1``.
   The default value is ``true``.
-  **systhreads=t**: Include system (VM) threads in the analysis if
   ``t``
   is ``true``.
   The default is false.

If the ``=t`` in the truth-valued options is omitted, it is the same as ``t=true``.

The profiler is implemented as a separate thread that wakes up periodically, based on the given frequency (slightly randomized), stops all threads and records their stack traces.
Since threads only stop at safepoints there is some inevitable inaccuracy in the reported trace.
In particular, a hot method that contains no loops will not appear in the output.
However, the stack trace will likely show the closest caller that contains a loop (or a system call that will cause the thread to reach a safepoint).

The data is output using the Maxine log mechanism, so can be captured in a file by setting the ``MAXINE_LOG_FILE`` environment variable.

Building Maxine without docker
------------------------------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maxine depends on the `MX tool <https://github.com/graalvm/mx>`__ for its build process.
To get it and add it to your ``PATH`` execute::

 sudo apt-get install python2.7           # MX depends on python 2.7
 mkdir -p $WORKDIR
 cd $WORKDIR
 git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx
 export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/mx

Maxine also depends on openJDK 8. To get it from the ubuntu repositories run::

 sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

Maxine is open source software, licensed under the GPL version 2.0 and is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/beehive-lab/Maxine-VM>`__.
Since Maxine is hosted in a git repository we need to install ``git`` as well::

 sudo apt-get install git

Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build maxine natively we first need to define a number of environment variables:

#. Define the directory you want to work in::

    export WORKDIR=/path/to/workdir

#. Define the JDK to be used::

    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

#. Define ``MAXINE_HOME``::

    export MAXINE_HOME=$WORKDIR/maxine

#. Optionally (needed to run ``maxvm`` binary directly):

  * Extend ``PATH`` to include the *to be generated* ``maxvm``::

     export PATH=$PATH:$MAXINE_HOME/com.oracle.max.vm.native/generated/linux/

  * Define ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``::

     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MAXINE_HOME/com.oracle.max.vm.native/generated/linux/

Get the source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Make sure the project directory exists and enter it::

    mkdir -p $WORKDIR
    cd $WORKDIR

#. Get the Maxine VM source code::

    git clone https://github.com/beehive-lab/Maxine-VM.git maxine

This command will create a directory named ``maxine`` with the contents checked out from the git repository.

Choice of Optimizing Compiler
-----------------------------

Maxine provides two optimizing compilers, C1X and Graal.
The former, an evolution of the Hostpot client compiler, is very stable but no longer under development.
Graal is more akin to the Hotspot server compiler and is under active development and improvement.
The default image build still uses C1X as the optimizing compiler, but it is possible to select Graal, both for runtime compilations and for compiling the VM boot image (the latter is currently unstable).
To build a boot image with Graal as the runtime optimizing compiler, use the following command::

 mx image @c1xgraal

In this case the optimizing compiler is actually a hybrid of C1X and Graal, with C1X being used as a fallback option if the Graal compilation fails.
Note that the VM boot image is considerably larger (~100MB) with Graal included.

To compile the boot image itself with Graal, do::

 mx image @c1xgraal-boot

The Graal-compiled VM boot image will execute a few simple test programs but currently is not robust enough to be the default.
