 * have the appropriate definitions of macros used in MaxineNative's definitions
 * for word sizing, endianness etc. Not doing this may cause (at least on Solaris)
 * incorrect definitions being picked up (e.g., _LP64 isn't defined yet by the
 * time word.h is pulled). Doing the include in this file (which all other depends on)
 * ensures that the necessary definitions have been pulled in.
